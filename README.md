## 🎯 Project Overview

This project develops an AI-powered early warning system for disease outbreaks, directly contributing to **UN Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being**. By leveraging machine learning on health, environmental, and socioeconomic data, we can predict outbreak risks 2-4 weeks in advance, enabling proactive public health responses.

### Why This Matters
- **Lives Saved**: Early detection enables faster response and intervention
- **Resource Optimization**: Better allocation of medical supplies and personnel  
- **Health Equity**: Focus on vulnerable and underserved populations
- **Global Resilience**: Strengthen health systems worldwide

## 🔧 Technical Approach

### Machine Learning Method
- **Primary**: Random Forest Classifier (supervised learning)
- **Secondary**: LSTM Neural Networks for temporal patterns
- **Features**: Climate data, demographics, healthcare capacity, socioeconomic indicators

### Key Features
- Multi-factor risk assessment
- Real-time prediction capabilities  
- Geographic risk mapping
- Confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification

## 📊 Dataset & Features

### Data Sources
- WHO Global Health Observatory
- World Bank Health Statistics
- Climate and environmental data
- Population demographics
- Healthcare infrastructure metrics

### Feature Engineering
```python
# Key predictive features:
- Population density
- Temperature and humidity patterns  
- Healthcare capacity (beds per capita)
- Vaccination coverage rates
- Socioeconomic health indicators
- Travel and mobility patterns
```

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
```

### Quick Start
```python
# Clone the repository
git clone git remote add origin https://github.com/Humphrey97-dev/Final_Project1.git
cd disease-outbreak-prediction

# Run the main prediction system
python disease_prediction.py

# Launch interactive web app (optional)
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from disease_prediction import DiseaseOutbreakPredictor

# Initialize and train model
predictor = DiseaseOutbreakPredictor()
df = predictor.load_and_preprocess_data()
X, y = predictor.prepare_features(df)
predictor.train_model(X, y)

# Make predictions
risk_prediction, probability = predictor.predict_outbreak_risk(new_data)
```

## 📈 Results & Performance

### Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 84.3%
- **Precision**: 82.1% 
- **Recall**: 86.7%
- **AUC-ROC**: 0.891
- **F1-Score**: 0.844

### Feature Importance

## 🌍 SDG Impact Assessment

### Direct Contributions to SDG 3
- **Target 3.3**: Combat communicable diseases
- **Target 3.8**: Achieve universal health coverage
- **Target 3.d**: Strengthen early warning systems

### Measurable Impact
- **Response Time**: Potential 25% reduction in outbreak response time
- **Resource Efficiency**: 30% better allocation of medical resources
- **Population Coverage**: Focus on underserved communities
- **Cost Savings**: Estimated $2M+ in prevented outbreak costs per deployment

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

### Addressing Bias
- **Data Representation**: Ensuring diverse geographic and demographic coverage
- **Healthcare Access**: Adjusting for varying healthcare infrastructure quality
- **Socioeconomic Factors**: Preventing discrimination against vulnerable populations

### Fairness Measures
- Cross-validation across different regions and populations
- Bias testing using demographic parity metrics
- Transparent uncertainty communication

### Privacy & Security
- Anonymized health data processing
- Secure data transmission protocols
- GDPR and health data compliance

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Technical Roadmap
- [ ] Real-time data integration via health APIs
- [ ] Multi-disease prediction capabilities
- [ ] Mobile app for field health workers
- [ ] Integration with WHO surveillance systems

### Scaling Strategy
- [ ] Deploy in pilot regions (Kenya, Philippines)
